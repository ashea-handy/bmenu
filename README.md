What is this fork of B-Menu?
---------------

This simple fork of B-Menu is intended to read from configuration files 
found in the Current Working Directory, as opposed to the home folder.

What is B-Menu?
---------------

B-Menu is a minimalistic general purpose terminal menu written in C. It was designed to replace
terminal-based login managers such as CDM. However, it can easily serve as a simple terminal menu for
any situation where you would like to execute a command from a set of menu selections.

B-Menu has zero dependencies, and it is intentionally feature-minimal. This keeps it easy to install, 
configure, and run. 

Note that due to the way I use the extended ascii character set to display menu borders and shading,
it is not portable to windows systems. (It’s not a bug, it’s a feature!)

Installation
------------
First, make sure you have the ncurses library installed:
```
ls /usr/include | grep ncurses.h
```
If the ncurses.h header file is not present, you may need to install the library. On Ubuntu, type:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ncurses-dev
```
If you are using a different flavor of linux, search your available packages for "ncurses" and install
it.

After ensuring ncurses is installed:
```
git clone https://github.com/bartobri/bmenu.git
cd ./bmenu/src
make
```

This will create the executable file `bmenu`. Most users will want to copy it to /usr/bin, but you can
place it anywhere you like.

Configuring The Menu
--------------------

By default, b-menu looks for menu options in $HOME/.bmenu (use `-c` to override,  see below). This file
should consist of one menu option and one command on each line, seperated by a colon.

Example:

```
Clear Screen:/usr/bin/clear
Dir Listing:/usr/bin/ls -l
```

Command Line Options
--------------------

Use the `-c` option to override the default menu file path:
```
bmenu -c /path/to/menu/file
```

Use the `-t` option to override the default menu prompt:
```
bmenu -t 'Choose an Option:'
```

Set Up B-Menu as a Login Manager
--------------------------------

To run b-menu when you login, place the following code in `$HOME/.bash_profile`:

```
if [[ "$(tty)" == '/dev/tty1' ]]; then
    [[ -n "$BMENU_SPAWN" ]] && return
    export BMENU_SPAWN=1
    # Avoid executing bmenu when X11 has already been started.
    [[ -z "$DISPLAY$SSH_TTY$(pgrep xinit)" ]] && exec bmenu
fi
```

If you do this, it is best to include a menu option to launch a shell. Add the following to your menu
options file:

```
Shell:/bin/bash --login
```
